## EtherCAT Installation from Repositories – Step-by-Step Guide
**Source:** [LinuxCNC Forum – rodw - EtherCAT Installation Guide](https://forum.linuxcnc.org/ethercat/45336-ethercat-installation-from-repositories-how-to-step-by-step)

&nbsp;
### 📦 1. Update Your System

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

---
&nbsp;
### 🔧 2. Install EtherCAT and LinuxCNC

```bash
sudo apt install ethercat-master
sudo apt install linuxcnc-uspace linuxcnc-uspace-dev
```

---
&nbsp;
### ⚙️ 3. Configure the EtherCAT Master

Search for the MAC-Address of the Port your Ethercat Master is connected to:
```bash
ip a
```

Now edit the following:
```bash
sudo geany /etc/ethercat.conf
```

Search for these settings:
```bash
MASTER0_DEVICE="xx:aa:yy:zz:bb:cc" (replace with your MAC)
DEVICE_MODULES="generic"
```

> Note, we have found in some circumstances ethercat master wants to use the first NIC listed in ip a if multiple NIC's are installed
If you experience problems after installation is complere, swap your network cables around and edit the MAC address in ethercat.conf\
--rodw

### 🔌 4. Enable and Start the EtherCAT Service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable ethercat.service
sudo systemctl start ethercat.service
sudo systemctl status ethercat.service
sudo chmod 666 /dev/EtherCAT0
```

---
&nbsp;
### ✅ 5. Check EtherCAT Status

```bash
ethercat slaves
```

You should see a list of your EtherCAT devices if everything is connected properly.

---
&nbsp;
### 🔐 6. Set Permissions for the EtherCAT Port on Startup
Creating a custom **udev rule**, to ensure the EtherCAT port has the correct permissions at boot time.

Create the udev rule file:
```bash
sudo geany /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ethercat.rules
```

Add the following line to the file:
```bash
KERNEL=="EtherCAT[0-9]", MODE="0777"
```

Reload udev rules
```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

❗ **Important:**

Without this rule, you would need to manually run chmod on the EtherCAT port after every reboot.
